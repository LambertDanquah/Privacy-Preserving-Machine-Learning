# Zero-Knowledge-Machine-Learning
ZKML is an intersection of Machine Learning, Zero-Knowledge Cryptography and Blockchain.

# Details of the Files in this repository
This repository consist of the projects I worked on during my zero-knowledge machine learning internship.
1. The file 'ZKP for XGBoost Fraud Detection' is a jupyter notebook showing how I used EZKL zero-knowledge machine learning framework to generate and verify proofs of XGBoost inference on fraud detection.
2. After my hands-on experience with EZKL-based zkML, I joined the Cryptography Research team to work on a 'Zero-Knowledge ML Research' as the PDF in the repository shows. The objective of the research was to reduce zero-knowledge proof generation time for Large Language Models (specifically Llama 2) compared to previous research works on ZKP for LLMs. The PDF contains my understanding of our team's proposed research based on the discussions we had. The significance of the work is evident from the write-up and its success will make zkLLM more feasible for industry implementation.
